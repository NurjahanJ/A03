- From the Code tab, create a new branch for your changes.
- Edit the file(s) that you want to modify in your branch.
- Commit your changes, and be sure to include a descriptive commit message.

-**Fetch**: To retrieve changes from a remote repository and update the local repository's references, but not merge them with the local branch.

-**GIT**: A version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase and keep track of changes over time.

-**Github**: A web-based hosting service for Git repositories that provides a platform for collaboration and code sharing.

-**Merge**: To combine two or more branches or commits into a single branch.

-**Merge Conflict**: When Git encounters conflicting changes between two branches or commits being merged, it presents a merge conflict that requires manual resolution.

-**Push**: To upload local changes to a remote repository.

-**Pull**: To retrieve changes from a remote repository and merge them with the local branch.
