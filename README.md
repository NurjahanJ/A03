10. Finally, delete the branch that you just merged into the main branch.


## Glossary Definatations:

-**Branch**: A separate copy of the codebase that allows developers to work on different features or changes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.

-**Clone**: To create a local copy of a repository on your machine so that you can work on it locally.

-**Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to the codebase that is saved in the repository's history. Each commit includes a message describing the changes made.

-**Fetch**: To retrieve changes from a remote repository and update the local repository's references, but not merge them with the local branch.

-**GIT**: A version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase and keep track of changes over time.

-**Github**: A web-based hosting service for Git repositories that provides a platform for collaboration and code sharing.

-**Merge**: To combine two or more branches or commits into a single branch.

-**Merge Conflict**: When Git encounters conflicting changes between two branches or commits being merged, it presents a merge conflict that requires manual resolution.

-**Push**: To upload local changes to a remote repository.

-**Pull**: To retrieve changes from a remote repository and merge them with the local branch.**

-**Remote**: A reference to a repository on a remote server that is used to synchronize changes between the local and remote repositories.

-**Repository**: A central location where code is stored and managed. It includes the complete history of all changes made to the codebase.
